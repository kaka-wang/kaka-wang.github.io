It was the afternoon in Wednesday this week and I was having two friends of PE class in 12:50 - 14:15.

I met Kevin as I get into the gym. After my teacher Andrew said it was free time. I invited Kevin to have a Badminton bed with me. We had three games in total and there was 11 scores in the game. I was excited because Kevin‘s standard is similar to me, and I was lose in the last battle. I was also a little nervous because I was afraid I will lose again.

I served at the first game but I faulted. And I lost 3 scores at the first. Then our score went hand in hand. However, Kevin faulted, and I finished the game by smashing.

In the second game, it was Kevin's turn to serve. He served with a highclear, but I predict he will shortservice, so I miss the ball. Because of the loss of physical strengh, I miss some scores like this at the beginning. To remain physical strength, I list the second game.

At the third game. I served still. (We throw the ball and look the direction of hte ball to decide who to serve). At this game, I use the skill I learnt before - serve the ball to the place that is the furthest from the opponent according to the place he stand. So I played an high ball to the back of Kevin's backhand side. (Kevin is a left-hand person so I serve it to the right). I used this skill to get three points so that there will be a big difference in score that prevent he beyond my score. However, I became highly conceited that I forgot Kevin is a left-hand person and I smashed the ball to his left side.  Because I am familiar to play with right-handed person. He got the ball and striked the ball gently to to make the ball and striked the ball gently to make the ball fell beside the net. As a result, I lost this score.

At the end of the third game, we got same score of 10, So we needed to have extra score to decide who is the winner. Both of us were heruous and tired. How ever, we both tried our best to beat the opponent. In the last round, Kevin beat the ball by the frame of the racket. I thought that ball won’t get over the net. However it flew over the net. So Kevin won the game finally.

I Was a little sad, however, the feeling was not so bad. It was even, a little relaxing. I realized that the most important thing in a competition is not to win, but to try your best to exert your strength and never give up.
